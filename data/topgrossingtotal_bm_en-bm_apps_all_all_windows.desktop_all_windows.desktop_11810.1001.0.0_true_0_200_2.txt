Change basic exposure parameters, control shutter and download pictures to your Windows device.\r\n\r\nPlease note to use this app your camera needs to have Wi-Fi capability or that the camera is accessible on a TCP/IP network. And the camera supports PTP/IP over its network connection.\r\n\r\nDepends on how well the camera supports generic PTP/IP protocol, some features of this app may not be available. Additional support can be obtained by contacting us using the support email.\r\n\r\nSetup with cameras that have Wi-Fi hosting capability:\r\n\r\n- Enable build-in Wi-Fi from your camera's configuration menu. If the camera is using a Wi-Fi adapter such as the WU-1a/1b, please follow the adapter's user instruction to setup the network.\r\n- Search for the camera's Wi-Fi access point from your Windows device's Wi-Fi settings.\r\n- From your Windows device, join the Wi-Fi network hosting by your camera\r\n- Launch the app, and configure it to connection to the correct IP address and port. (default settings should work for Nikon cameras and a few others)\r\n- Tap 'connect' to establish PTP/IP connection to your camera\r\n\r\n\r\nSetup with cameras that connects to an existing network:\r\n\r\n- Turn on camera's Wi-Fi networking and specify an existing wireless access point to connect to. For cameras that are using a network adapter, follow the adapter's user instruction to setup networking.\r\n- To find out the IP address assigned to the camera, login to your wireless router's web admin console or check your DHCP server's client list\r\n- Launch the app, and configure it to connection to the correct IP address and port. \r\n- Tap 'connect' to establish PTP/IP connection to your camera\r\n\r\nThe following are some basic network diagnostic steps in case you are having issues with setting up networks\r\n- Assume your camera's wi-fi network is started,\r\n- Make sure your PC has connected to the camera's wi-f network\r\n- Make sure there is NO OTHER active network connections on your PC,\r\n- Make sure there is NO OTHER smart devices connected to your camera\r\n- From PC, open command prompt (start menu->enter cmd and hit enter)\r\n- from PC command prompt, enter command: ipconfig /all\r\n- This should list all active network connections on your PC, scroll down to find the Wi-Fi network interface, \r\n- make sure a valid IP address such as 192.168.1.2 is assigned to your wifi adapter\r\n\r\n- Check the IP address of 'default gateway' assigned to your wi-fi adapter, this is your camera's IP address. and should be used in the app as the destination IP.\r\n\r\n- From the command prompt, try ping your camera Ip address by enter the command ping 192.168.1.1 (replace your camera's IP address if required). IF the network is setup correctly, you should see reply for each ping request. IF the network is not setup correctly, you would see error message such as 'request time out' or 'destination is unreachable' etc.\r\n","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9PL8MZ224TF2","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"Ultra File Opener","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.5106.14317741923188107.07003658-d6d2-4fa4-9c56-42c6cfeb7af0.e25d8642-25d6-4a32-bf42-58667cde4c17","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.45457.14317741923188107.07003658-d6d2-4fa4-9c56-42c6cfeb7af0.12e54529-2a2d-4d7f-9b6b-8305eded6794","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63998.14317741923188107.07003658-d6d2-4fa4-9c56-42c6cfeb7af0.73b6c78a-335a-47e4-8f7c-92425744e97b","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.33459.14317741923188107.07003658-d6d2-4fa4-9c56-42c6cfeb7af0.0bd17fd9-ba57-4d21-9673-21bab116b54d","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["D5BE6627.371995F5E41A5_9pm2v9747qaaa"],"ContentIds":["68c23ebf-2f12-a44a-ea2c-87bcb1f6fe17"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Ultra File Opener (UFO) App is available in both FREE and FULL versions.\r\n\r\nFREE Version can:\r\n* View over 200 file formats for free\r\n* Limited to viewing only (converting and printing inaccessible)\r\n\r\nFULL Version can:\r\n* Open over 350 file formats\r\n* Edit, save, and print files\r\n* Convert and batch convert image files at lightning speed\r\n* Open, edit, and convert camera raw files\r\n* Extract files from compressed archives\r\n* and more.\r\n\r\nNOTE for DVD users: Ultra File Opener doesn't play discs automatically.

The king, unable to reconcile himself with the hopeless union, sent his son on a crusade and, in his absence, drove his young wife out of the castle. The king had counted on the fact that the prince would eventually forget about her, but his plans were ruined when his heir died in battle, and the prince’s beloved wife gave birth to a child and died in confinement.

Edit. Share. Smile. The free Adobe Photoshop Express app provides photo magic at your fingertips. \r\n\r\nJoin millions of creative folks who trust and use Adobe Photoshop Express for fast, powerful, and easy editing. This is the one-stop shop for your quick and fabulous photo editing needs.\r\n\r\nUse Adobe Photoshop Express to create better looking pictures. Use slide bar adjustments or automatic one-touch fixes to achieve great results. If you’re new to the app, here are few ways to improve your photos:\r\n\r\nINTRODUCING NEW LOOKS AND BORDERS:\r\n\r\nCREATIVE LOOKS:\r\n\r\n* Now choose from more than 45 eye-catching effects called Looks! Control the intensity of Looks with a simple slider. Different categories of Looks like Black and White, Portrait, Nature, Pop Color, and Duo Tones help to get you the right effect to apply.\r\nBORDERS:\r\n\r\n* Use our newly added Borders to add a distinctive personal touch to your photos with 30+ borders and frames. Express yourself!\r\nEDIT PHOTOS:\r\n\r\n* Quickly open photos from the device.\r\n* Snap pictures from right within the app.\r\n* Edit photos to their possible best. An easy to use interface provides seamless switching between various edits.\r\n* The comprehensive photo editor allows you to polish your photos so that you can turn your imagination to reality.\r\n\r\nCROP:\r\n\r\n* Fix photos fast — crop, straighten, rotate clockwise and anticlockwise, flip horizontal and vertical.\r\n\r\n* Crop also provides easy one-touch default aspect ratios.\r\n\r\nCORRECTIONS:\r\n\r\nMake your photos pop with simple sliders:\r\n\r\n* Control and set contrast, clarity, saturation, vibrance, dehaze\r\nUse these controls in your photos to produce stunning results. \r\nContrast is an attention-grabbing control that can turn your ordinary photo into a dazzling masterpiece.\r\nAdjust the color saturation using the Vibrance and Saturation controls.\r\nAdjust clarity slider to reveal more texture and detail in your photos.\r\nUse the Dehaze slider to add or remove haze from your photo.\r\n\r\n* Exposure, highlights, shadows, blacks and whites\r\nYou can fine-tune the photo’s exposure setting using the Exposure adjustment controls. Highlights and Shadows are the best way to optimize your photo’s exposure in highlights, midtones, and shadows, without compromising on other areas of tonality.\r\nUse Blacks and Whites to set black point and white point of the photo. This makes colors appear completely black or white.\r\n\r\n* Temperature and Tint\r\nUse Temperature and Tint controls to introduce warmth or coldness to your photo. You can also control the amount of green and red tones in your photo.\r\nUse the Temperature slider controls to increase or decrease the amount of orange or blue tone.

The memories still burn deeply, like spicy chicken wings.\r\n\r\n\"They came without warning, squawking menacingly, their ruffled feathers darkening the sun. Invading intergalactic chickens, out to punish humanity for our oppression of their earthly brethren.\r\n\r\n\"I instantly knew what had to be done. I dropped my half-eaten chicken burger and jumped in my cockpit. With a greasy finger I set my lasers to \"extra crispy\" and blasted off to intercept the fowl invaders.\r\n\r\n\"It wasn't easy. Squawks, feathers flying, the smell of charred chicken everywhere. Three times they invaded, each time with increasingly devious plans. Three times I managed to push them back whence they came, and secure humanity a few more years as the dominant species of this planet.\r\n\r\n\"After their last retreat, I headed for my local Space Burger to bask in the glow of my recent victory. Breathing a sigh of relief, I sat down to enjoy a double chicken-burger with crispy chicken wings on the side.\r\n\r\n\"Little did I know that my greatest adventure was yet to come...\"\r\n\r\n\"Ultimate Omelette\" is the title of the fourth episode in the Chicken Invaders series of casual space shooter games. The game puts players at the forefront of a battle against invading intergalactic chickens, bent on revenge against the human race for our oppression of Earth chickens. In this episode, the chickens have constructed a gigantic cannon capable of launching planet-scale eggs against Earth, with the ultimate goal of encrusting humanity in an impenetrable wall made of egg white. Joined by an unlikely ally, players will travel to foreign, unexplored galaxies in an effort to locate and destroy the egg cannon before it reaches Earth.\r\n\r\nThe enemy repertoire has been significantly broadened, introducing several different kinds of chickens which attack relentlessly in colorful groups and meticulously choreographed formations. The chicken fray is punctuated by fights against boss enemies spanning up to three times the size of the screen. The arsenal at the player's disposal has also been correspondingly extended, with three new weapons and four kinds of supporting satellites providing additional firepower. The player's intergalactic journey is also accentuated by unique fantastic scenarios, such as navigating through a field of gigantic floating feathers, or dodging molten planet chunks during a supernova explosion.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFJ9WH","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Chinese Chess Online","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.12079.9007199266251882.3c4500eb-0ff2-4916-adc0-18571b1428ed.c1a849c0-232d-4b67-9d98-c7b486e493b6","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.62510.9007199266251882.1f6920d6-cd57-46b5-bc2f-6f0d2f6b4eef.dadf8b43-b015-4957-8ade-f40834af4387","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["19363BlueskyStudio.ChineseChessOnline_ad90gx91p0mxj"],"ContentIds":["848372d5-c678-9254-7609-e8eabdf4d332","31c623c5-c8d4-4172-a874-7adea769730a"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Play Chinese Chess(XiangQi) online with players all over the world.

Use your cunning to kill or tame the primeval creatures roaming the land, and encounter other players to survive, dominate... and escape! \r\n\r\nTAME, TRAIN, BREED & RIDE DINOSAURS, IN A LIVING ECOSYSTEM\r\nOver 50 creatures can be tamed using a challenging subdue-&-protect process. Weaken a feral creature to knock it out, and then nursing it to health. Once tamed, you can issue commands to your Pet, which it may follow depending on how well you’ve tamed and trained it. Pets continue to level-up and consume food, and carry Inventory and Equipment.  Fly a Pteranodon over the mountains, race through the jungle with a pack of Raptors, or chase down prey on a T-Rex! Experience a dynamic ecosystem with its own predator & prey hierarchies. Breed Pets through successive generations to generate the best traits. Or put more simply, breed & raise Dino Babies!\r\n\r\nFOOD, WATER, TEMPERATURE AND WEATHER\r\nEat and drink to survive, with different foods having different nutritional values (including human meat!). All actions drain food and water, and long-distance travel is draining. Inventory weight slows you down, and the day/night cycle and weather alter the environment. Craft clothing, build shelter, and use fire to protect yourself against damage & the elements.\r\n\r\nHARVEST, CRAFT, AND PAINT ITEMS\r\nHarvest trees, ore, and more to become a master crafter. Use your hands, a Smithy, or a Fabricator to craft increasingly complex and powerful gear. Build a massive base using modular pieces--ranging from Thatch, to Wood, to Stone, to Metal. Customize your base by painting it and placing signs that you can actually draw on. Weapons, clothing, & armor gear can also be painted to express your own visual style.\r\n\r\nSUMMON THE ULTIMATE LIFE FORMS\r\nBring rare items to special Summon locations to awaken the ARK’s mythical creatures, who arrive ready for battle. These monstrosities provide an end-game goal for the most experienced Tribes and their Pets, and yield valuable items if they are defeated.\r\n\r\nRPG STATISTICS\r\nLevel-Up your survivor by gaining experience through in-game actions to learn new crafting Engrams, or find higher level item Blueprints in the most dangerous parts of the ARK. Customize the look of your character with a complex character creation system.\r\n\r\nHARDCORE MECHANICS\r\nItems have durability and wear out with use if not repaired. When you leave the game, your character remains “sleeping” in the persistent world. Your inventory also exists in the persistent world, vulnerable to theft. Death means permanent loss, and you can even enslave other players for your own purposes.\r\n\r\nLARGE WORLD PERSISTENCE\r\nOn the 70+ player servers, your character, everything you built, and your pets stay in-game even when you leave. Special themed events will occur in the world with corresponding limited-run items!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9PHKXB8RDKBC","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Forza Horizon 4 Deluxe Edition","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.913.14229724971193324.2000000000007864630.71ab5641-11af-4813-89d6-5176f4cb173d","Height":2160,"Width":2160,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"#FFFFFF","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61966.14229724971193324.2000000000007864596.5efc00e9-f8fa-48a3-89a2-60e31be565f4","Height":2160,"Width":1440,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"#FFFFFF","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"USD$79.99⁺","Price":79.99,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":[""],"ContentIds":[],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Xbox One","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Dynamic seasons change everything at the world’s greatest automotive festival.
