Each stack must start with an Ace, followed by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen and end with a King. \r\n✓ At the beginning of the game, all the cards are dealt into 8 columns. At the top of the screen you will find 4 free cells and 4 foundations. Use the free cells to temporarily store one card at a time during the game.\r\n✓ Once you place a card in the foundation you cannot take it back. Make sure you no longer need it before placing it there.\r\n✓ You can move a card from one column to another if the top card from the other column is +1 higher and is of a different color. For example, you can put a 3 of hearts over a 4 of spades. Or you can put a 10 of clubs over a Jack of diamonds.\r\n✓ You can move an entire series of cards if you have enough free positions. Empty columns and empty free cells are considered free positions. The series of cards must be smaller or equal than the number of free positions plus 1. For example, if you have 2 empty free cells and one empty column you can move at most 4 cards at a time.\r\n✓ If you cannot move a stack because it is too large you can try splitting it into two parts. Then you can reassemble it in a new column.\r\n\r\n\r\n★ Support and Feedback\r\nIf you have any technical problems, please email us directly at support@gsoftteam.com.

The coins are also used to restore lives and buy rum for the sailors in order to open new episodes.\r\nCollect treasures, compete with your friends and become a real pirate!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGGZN7SQ","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"RC-AirSim Lite","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.28436.13510798883407381.47a4f440-a939-4421-b251-9ce1dffa9184.14f3d87e-bb46-4a37-8a7f-33b019a6da05","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.46597.13510798883407381.a989a9d0-66fb-49d4-82ac-02609df6059e.a8996402-f95b-4059-8d4d-5a51e079805b","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.22053.13510798883407381.018aff0e-9418-4dd7-9fb3-11fc5efc260a.7d535ef7-486a-41ca-9c89-ba565dd43ecd","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.32155.13510798883407381.203ab517-2ea5-451f-8b62-bc3d912e3398.981015fd-da1d-4fe8-af33-8a6b1e199873","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.21887.13510798883407381.ba2a1c6e-0e2f-4bda-af56-91dfbb6b3921.0913e03d-940f-4f9e-a18b-36cdeee969bb","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.52801.13510798883407381.72963bbb-5682-48ed-b1f7-4602c55d8e89.f00afc17-5c1b-4bc6-a241-d42c0a098451","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.0,"RatingsCount":"4","PackageFamilyNames":["47179FabricatedReality.RC-AirSimLite_s06pkavjfgen8"],"ContentIds":["d486311d-f186-bc69-e85a-eb767939c8ee"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Learn to fly r/c model airplanes with this advanced realistic flight simulator! Fly with Mouse, Keyboard, Touch, or Xbox 360 Controller.\r\n\r\nRC-AirSim Lite is the FREE Version of RC-AirSim and features 2 beginner model airplanes with unlimited flying!\r\n\r\nRC-AirSim is a favorite of radio-controlled model airplane pilots worldwide because it excels where it matters most: realistic flight dynamics and aerodynamics! Tired of \"simulators\" that feel unrealistic and fly like an arcade game? Try RC-AirSim! Experienced R/C pilots say that RC-AirSim feels and flies like an actual r/c model airplane! R/C pilots, don't let your skills get rusty when you are away from the flying field: practice with RC-AirSim. New to the hobby of r/c model airplanes? Learn on RC-AirSim first and make the maiden flight of your first r/c plane a successful one.\r\n\r\nRC-AirSim Lite features: \r\n\r\n· Fly a high wing Trainer airplane or an easy to fly Electric Parkflyer.\r\n· Realistic r/c model airplane flight aerodynamics based on NASA flight simulation technology. \r\n· Awesome Crashes! Planes break apart in a realistic physics-based manner. \r\n· Accurate Landings and Ground Handling. \r\n· 3 View Options - R/C, Following (Chase cam), and Onboard camera. Click camera icon to change. \r\n· 4 Channel Controls - aileron, elevator, rudder, throttle. \r\n· Optional On-screen Transmitter Sticks. \r\n· Fly with Mouse, Keyboard, Touch, or Xbox 360 Controller. \r\n· 3 control modes: Mode 2 (default), Mode 1, and 3 Channel. \r\n· Field objects to avoid and fly behind. (Not just a panoramic background photo environment.) \r\n· Doppler-correct sound. \r\n· Get flying quickly!

Recall your childhood!\r\n\r\nLudo game that traces its lineage to 6th century India. Ludo is derived from game Pachisi. Ludo is also very similar to Spanish board game.\r\n\r\nLudo game has stayed popular throughout the ages, varying only a little in its game structure. This persevering game is now available for you to play in an all new modernized format, i.e. as a video game application.\r\n\r\nThe game is played between 2 to 4 players and you have the option of playing the game against the computer, against your friends, or even against people from around the world. The objective of the game is pretty straightforward; each player gets 4 tokens, these tokens must make a full turn of the board and then make it to the finish line.\r\n\r\nWhoever gets all four tokens to the end first is the winner. However, each move can only be made based on the number decided by casting a six-sided die, and each token can only move out of their home by casting a six. Additionally, the competition factor of the games is upped by the fact that while moving if another player’s token lands on the same square as your token, then your token will automatically be sent back home and you’ll need to roll a six again.\r\n\r\nLudo King is a game that was played by kings and now it can be enjoyed by you and your family and friends. While the game play might seem simple at first, the game is immensely enjoyable and challenging. You’ll be playing this one for hours and its fun for the whole family. Try to beat your opponents and compete for the highest scores on the leaderboards.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH4VZCV","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Helicopter Rescue Flight Sim","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.23863.13510798887514383.6cde30d4-c1e1-41de-8ed2-84ac626f3eee.741cc22e-2a2f-4cde-b787-021492065b86","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.35291.13510798887514383.c43044e0-3ee2-4ae8-a857-5249fbac2d27.d1a67fec-b2e3-4826-abd2-7ebe621788c1","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.26163.13510798887514383.8c1943dd-1350-409e-aca9-e1574a12f79c.1399e833-ea52-46f4-ab81-7402c6b32d1c","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":1.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["56499UkArtsGames.HelicopterRescueFlightSim_ep77ya5xk0qyg"],"ContentIds":["96f6a32f-632c-7b53-bc8c-7816f8274288","5a1237a7-18b5-48b4-c747-2a370f8b57bc"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Helicopter Rescue Flight Sim presents for the first time an advance flight simulator rescue game.

The killer whale is in a ferocious mood. The thrill of controlling a fierce angry whale is unmatchable. Angry whale simulator 2016 is a super animal simulator and gives you a chance to watch and simulate a killer whale attack in deep sea and on the beach. So dive into the ocean and be a part of this adventure as an Angry Whale as this orca knows no stopping.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnimal simulators give you the opportunity to observe the wildlife and sea animal life from a close perspective. Angry Whale Simulator 2016 will give you that chance of controlling a whale that attacks and eat underwater animals and humans alike. The Orca whale experience is better than the shark jaws or piranha. Whales are huge animals that can stay both in deep and shallow waters and once they come close to surface, can run havoc on the beach and the boats.

Teleport around, explore the arena, have a conversation, or do a silly dance together. Once you are ready, join into the arena for a casual game. Simply guess what someone else is drawing or draw something for others to guess. NEW: multiplayer MR Paintball, splatter your friends or the arena with lovely colors. Remember to dodge and refill!\r\n\r\nFollow us on Twitter at https://twitter.com/Paint_Arena and share videos or screenshots of your best 3D paintings or MR paintball games with hashtag #Paint_Arena :)\r\n\r\nConceptualization: \r\nMany virtual reality games today are designed to enhance graphic intensity and immersion, but increasingly isolate the players. We believe Windows Mixed Reality can be much more than that. We decided to design a casual game that people of all ages can play, share, and socialize in mixed reality. We were inspired by a classic interactive puzzle game for friends and family, while we were amazed by the potential of the mixed reality motion controllers, so Paint Arena was born. Many thanks to Mixed Reality Academy for the paint brush example.  \r\n\r\nInstructions:\r\nYou will need a HoloLens or a WMR immersive headset with a mixed reality motion controllers (and headphones, if not Samsung Odyssey) to enjoy this experience.\r\n\r\nThis social experience is best enjoyed in a casual standing pose. If you feel you are not at the right height after app launch, simply stand up, look forward, and say or tap \"Reset Floor Level\". \r\n\r\nYou could draw and talk to others and guess each others' drawings. If you are the first one to join, you would be assigned the drawer for the first round. You would be given a random word. Draw something to help others guess the word (without drawing any letters or digits). Once someone guesses your word correctly, a guesser will chosen at random to become the drawer. \r\n\r\nToggle \"Painting On\" to \"Paint Balling\" to start shooting paintballs and splatter the arena. Each full tank contains 100 paintballs. Every 5 seconds, you can partially refill the tank with 20 paintballs by pressing \"Refill 20 Paintballs\" button or saying the voice command \"Refill Paint Ball\". Try to move around to dodge incoming paintballs, or teleport to reposition. Score by reducing others' health bars to zero, upon which they would enter ghost mode and respawn at a random location in 10 seconds. \r\n\r\nIn Immersive headsets: Make sure you set up boundary for all experiences before you begin. While \"Painting On\", once you see your robotic right hand holding a paint brush, you can press the right hand trigger button to start drawing. While \"Paint Balling\", you can aim with your right hand controller, and press right hand trigger to shoot paintballs.\r\n\r\nOnce you see your robotic left arm holding a motion controller, you can use the touch pad to select paint color. Alternatively, you can tap \"Pick Color\" to bring up the large color wheel. \r\n\r\nIf you made a mistake, you can say \"Erase Last Stroke\" or press right hand controller grab button. You can also clear all strokes by saying \"Erase All Strokes\". \r\n\r\nTo rotate your view, point the joysticks left or right on one of the motion controllers. \r\n\r\nTo teleport, make sure the panel shows \"Teleport On\". Then point your cursor at the floor with one of the motion controllers, and hold the joystick forward until a Teleport marker appears, then release the joystick. \r\n\r\nIn HoloLens, you can use gaze, tap gesture to select options on the menu in front of you (look below chest level). You can use the same voice commands as elaborated above. While \"Painting On\", you can reach your hand out in front of you, pinch and hold while dragging the paint brush along. While \"Paint Balling\", you can aim with your gaze and air tap to shoot paintballs.\r\n\r\nBefore teleporting in HoloLens, make sure the panel shows \"Teleport On\". Then you can use your gaze to aim, and then tap to dash across the map! You could also hide the Guessing Window and the Panel if they are blocking your gazes. Remember to turn off teleport before drawing or shooting. \r\n\r\n\r\n","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NLLRQZJ1KJV","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Logo Quiz +","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.20660.13705319199079409.3be31a45-7ce9-48fb-b8ad-7a8791517364.be3184d0-d1bb-48ab-997d-5eff58290b69","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.25876.13705319199079409.3be31a45-7ce9-48fb-b8ad-7a8791517364.b7c018c5-7221-462b-b578-41eb9586e8b9","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.20660.13705319199079409.3be31a45-7ce9-48fb-b8ad-7a8791517364.be3184d0-d1bb-48ab-997d-5eff58290b69","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["57591LegendsSonicSagaGame.LogoQuiz_78eft1qs6c52t"],"ContentIds":["1636a72a-0236-830a-9a5e-8ce9d3fdfec4","e6f69919-93a5-9e68-1f8c-dc3a73ae48e5"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"How many of brand logos can you guess? ★ Logo Quiz Game ★\r\nGuess the brands with #1 world Logo Quiz game! \r\nBest trivia game ever!

Backgammon is a board game in which you move the pieces around the board according to dice rolls. Once you get all the pieces in the house you take them out according to your dice. The first player to get all the pieces out wins the game.\r\nDownload and play now!\r\n\r\n\r\n★ ★ ★ FEATURES ★ ★ ★ \r\n\r\n✓ challenging AI\r\n\r\n✓ auto bear off\r\n\r\n✓ easy to select and move pieces\r\n\r\n✓ fluid animations \r\n\r\n✓ HD graphics\r\n\r\n✓ detailed statistics\r\n\r\n✓ nice music and sound effects\r\n\r\n★ ★ ★ TIPS ★ ★ ★ \r\n\r\n✓ Your pieces are white and your opponent's pieces are black. There are 24 places on the board and two places to deposit the pieces. The 24 places are represented as triangles and called points. So the 1-point is the first place where pieces can stay. \r\n\r\n✓ The points from 1 to 6 are called the opponents’ home and the points from 19 to 24 are your home on the board. The opponent needs to bring all his pieces in the home region in order to take them out and so do you.\r\n\r\n✓ You can move around the board in one direction. You move from the bottom-right corner to the bottom-left corner then to the top-left corner and finally to the top-right corner on a path that resembles a horseshoe. The points from 1 to 24 follow this path in the same direction. Your opponent moves in the opposite direction following this path. \r\n\r\n✓ The game starts with a couple of dice rolls that decide which player should begin first. The opponent rolls first, then you. The one with the biggest pips’ count on the dice starts first. A pip is a dot on the face of a dice which counts as a point of movement or placement.\r\n\r\n✓ When your turn comes you start by rolling the dice and continue by making the moves.\r\n\r\n✓ If you roll a double your pips count will be twice the pips�� sum of the dice.\r\n\r\n✓ After you roll the dice some top pieces on your triangles, will be highlighted. You can start your move with any of those highlighted pieces. To move the pieces, you select the piece by tapping on the triangle on which it lies. Then, at that point the triangle turns blue and the places to which you can move next turn green. Tap on any of those green triangles to initiate the move. When the move ends and if there are moves left on the dice new pieces will be highlighted.\r\n\r\n✓ If one of your dice is one you can move one of your pieces only one position. If the piece lies on 2-point you can move it on 3-point for example. If you roll a double, you can make four moves with the same value of the dice from that roll.\r\n\r\n✓ You can move your pieces to columns occupied by your pieces, to empty places or places in which your opponent has one piece. \r\n\r\n✓ If you move your piece over the opponent's single piece you can capture it.\r\n\r\n\r\n★ Support and Feedback\r\n\r\nIf you have any technical problems, please email us directly at support@gsoftteam.com.

We specialize in educational games with the fun built right into them.\r\n\r\nLet's do the rest of the description in a question-and-answer form.\r\n\r\n★★★★★ How is the game played? ★★★★★\r\n\r\nIn the first lesson, children listen to the names of colors while a fun brush puts a big splash of the color on an easel, accompanied by an entertaining sound effect that makes the splash against the easel sound real.\r\n\r\nThen children learn how to recognize colors with a series of colorful jellyfish that float down with likable expressions on their faces. The pleasant lady announcer asks kids to choose the blue, yellow, purple, or black jellyfish. Each time children choose the correct one, she congratulates them with encouraging words like \"Perfect!\" and \"You're Good!\"\r\n\r\nNext, children discover how to build their color memories. An identical, pretty design shows up on the screen in rows. When kids tap on one of the designs, a color is revealed. Then the color disappears behind the design. Kids keep tapping until they remember where some of the colors are. Then when they tap on a design that matches one of the colors they remember the location of, they go back and tap it.\r\n\r\n★★★★★ What will my children learn? ★★★★★\r\n\r\nLike all Intellijoy games, the game focuses on a specific educational lesson, so children and their parents find the game really inviting and distraction-free.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, your child will learn:\r\n\r\n✔ The names of colors by splashing colors onto an easel.\r\n\r\n✔ How to recognize colors by being asked to do things like \"Choose the purple jellyfish.\"\r\n\r\n✔ Build memory skills by matching a color they've just seen.\r\n\r\nWe love to hear from parents – and from children, too. To tell us how we made a difference in your child's education or your sanity level, please rate our app and post a comment.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDG75C","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Benji Bananas Adventures","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.5606.9007199266303242.7bfcaafe-4a1d-4fff-9f48-0db6166b76d8.00326f41-815a-4a23-ae88-538199ca3697","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.48451.9007199266303242.12bcdb86-bbec-40df-8c31-0c488a04c89f.3e7ce117-032e-4189-8df5-c749598b1165","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.42553.9007199266303242.52e68cd8-e635-44f5-a501-a594d00bd21f.b1c651bc-070e-4fcc-9304-190773bbb35d","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.27666.9007199266303242.e0a0a128-76a6-4595-a1b3-402ce4e90cb0.78ee3829-167a-42b4-81a6-645280566c73","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.13280.9007199266303242.35dd8043-d241-46c8-9843-28e23f7a4d17.26e1202c-e970-4e90-8648-f9b18a58e9f9","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63953.9007199266303242.f7f3e6c4-feeb-4ef6-af0b-adc29d328024.52b38806-3c62-489f-9289-42c7fa93a3d4","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.9772.9007199266303242.b6b20460-c7a3-4b5d-b0cd-92c1c9d0d306.ad6c4786-c6df-4fb6-87a0-27a631aaece8","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":1.0,"RatingsCount":"2","PackageFamilyNames":["BenjiBananas.BenjiBananasAdventures_jk5exrty1qj4c"],"ContentIds":["81416b6b-1171-dbbd-8860-a952da9ce289","f1caeee3-0d1e-cd99-81ea-91b4cb8f917a"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"In Benji Bananas Adventures, everyone's favorite swinging monkey returns for more action in the jungle.

Realistic model behavior, lifelike heli models and flying fields. Do not fly your real model before trying this program! Will save you many $$$ and days in waiting for model parts. Crashing model here cost nothing. Learn to fly without fear. Rain or wind outside, start flying right now! \r\n\r\nThe program includes many popular helicopter models of different type:\r\n- Beginners co-axial models\r\n- Entry level collective pitch models\r\n- Advanced fully 3D aerobatic models\r\n- High fidelity scale models\r\n\r\nWe also include many RC plane models, RC boat and RC car models. This is the most complete and realistic RC simulator available!\r\n\r\nNote: we are constantly adding more, you will see them listed when you install the program!\r\n\r\nThe program includes different flying fields, boat and car race tracks.\r\n\r\nWe also includes 3 interactive object sets that can be loaded on any flying field. The interactive objects can be used for learning landing and precise model control. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the fixed point camera that represents the RC pilot point of view, we have included follow up camera that allows for walking behind the model. That is useful when you just start, so the model never gets away. \r\n\r\nPlease try our full featured professional RC flight simulator ClearView for PC here: http://rcflightsim.com - see the video of ClearView bellow.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes: \r\n1. This is not a game. You are controlling flying rc models that reacts like real flying models. It takes some time to learn, and again, do not expect \"arcade\" style controls. \r\n2. The onscreen control sticks are just indicators! They are made small so they do not obscure the screen. \r\n\r\n*** You do not need to keep your fingers on them *** \r\n\r\nSliding your finger any where on the right screen half affects the right control stick , the same for the left screen part - sliding finger there moves the left control stick. \r\n\r\nWe suggest to select beginner settings at first few days before you can comfortably progress further.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDNC4R","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Free Cards Games","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.10622.9007199266466396.ba2f267a-6ce9-4d26-b627-4bedfec0f5e7.5cba467e-9abc-4482-a03c-ea989888b47f","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61468.9007199266466396.9d56dee6-ff28-44fa-94cd-8027b9fdb5b0.4959d4bb-734b-4285-8d43-d7d5bcd656e8","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["12291raymond.li.FreeCardsGames_szs6zaftcmqhc"],"ContentIds":["c4971e7f-7c4a-16ae-c54a-3fc655cf83c4","30300fbc-b08e-85f2-7702-2c2cd33065e1","2976492c-4a28-0d82-c848-b782d24b4808"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Free Cards Games are solitaire games.

Drifting involves fast cars, super skilled drivers and hardcore fans. \r\n\r\nIt’s a combination of driving skill, style and showmanship. It’s all about loss of the rear wheel traction while keeping the race car in total control. Drifting is so popular because it brings all the best aspects of motor sports into one package. \r\n____________________________________\r\n\r\n•Available in the following languages: English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Russian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Chinese\r\n\r\nSUPPORT: http://driftmania2.com  \r\nVISIT US: http://ratrodstudio.com   \r\nFOLLOW US: twitter.com/ratrodstudiolay against a friend using the new online multiplayer mode.
