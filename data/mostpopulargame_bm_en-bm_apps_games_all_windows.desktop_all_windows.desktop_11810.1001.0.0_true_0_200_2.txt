There is no regard to what may be a lie; a truth untold. The villain is always hated; the hero adored beyond all else. No one stops to consider what has brought the villain to these circumstances. Was he a victim himself? Perhaps his story has been twisted, written by the winner, the warrior all adore and root for. But you can never truly understand the villain until you look from behind the lens of the hero's vantage. His is a story that must be heard. Sometimes it's a truth we have to do bad things for good results, and when that happens, people often forget all the good beforehand. You haven't heard the full story until you learn monster's have nightmares too... and will do anything to ensure their reality never dawns.\r\n\r\nLEVEL ONE - Military Plane\r\nThis initial level is prepared with challenging game timers that begin an immediate countdown upon entering.

Build, expand, plan your strategy, the decision is in your hands!\r\nBut don’t stop there, recruit dozens of funny characters, add them to your collection and watch as they populate the streets and bring your city to life!\r\n\r\nBuild the BEST. CITY. EVER.\r\n- Craft hundreds of unique, gorgeous buildings in your city and expand it from a tiny, peaceful town to a big, bustling metropolis.\r\n- Don’t forget to decorate your skyline by building famous landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, the Tower of London or the Tower of Pisa (there’s something for every tower fan) to elevate your city to the top tourist destinations.\r\n\r\nMeet your new family \r\n- Cartoon fans rejoice! Meet and collect tons of funny characters with their own unique personalities, like the portly Sergeant Cakemore, or the uber-macho builder guy, Forest Manly (whose real skill is the tiny bit too suggestive eyebrow raise).\r\n- Build a water tower. Check! Build a fire station. Check! But who’s going to drive the fire truck? Assigning citizens to jobs will help you optimize your city, but you can go even further! Send them on missions and they won’t come home empty handed or do favors for them so they would invite their friends too to fill your city!\r\n\r\nFusion is the way to go\r\n- The future: age of smart forks, exploding hover boards, even selfies! But now the 21st century lives up to its promise, with the ability to merge buildings into advanced skyscrapers and unlock specializations.\r\n- Unlocking each allows you to develop your city towards different directions and expand your collection with specialized buildings such as Sustainability, Commerce, Education and Entertainment. Choose which one suits your strategy best!\r\n\r\nThe grass is always greener…\r\n- But is it really? Find out by visiting the cities of your friends. Is your friend the best builder you know? Well, you can always “borrow” a bit of their ideas to improve your game … sshhh, we won’t tell anyone…\r\n- In case you find yourself short on some crucial resources, visiting the Trade HQ should be a major part of your strategy, it is where you can collect some extra cash or find missing upgrade items.\r\n\r\n\r\n**** Game not optimized for Nokia 2520.\r\n\r\n_____________________________________________\r\n\r\nVisit our official site at http://gmlft.co/website_EN\r\nCheck out the new blog at http://gmlft.co/central\r\n\r\nDon't forget to

Well meet it's daddy: Crazy Eights. Did you know, that the name Crazy Eights dates to the 1940s, derived from the military designation for discharge of mentally unstable soldiers, Section 8? The game is very popular especially with children. There are many variations of the basic game, and a number of different names including Crates, UNO, Last One, Mau-Mau, Pesten, Rockaway, Spoons, Swedish Rummy, Switch, Last Card, Screw Your Neighbour, and Tschausepp. \r\n\r\nEight cards are dealt to each player. Players discard by matching rank or suit with the top card of the discard pile, starting with the player left of the dealer. If a player is unable to match the rank or suit of the top card of the discard pile and does not have an eight, he draws one card from the stockpile. If he has a card he can play it otherwise the turn passes to the next player. If still doesn't have a card, he passes a turn to a next player. When a player plays an eight, he or she must declare the suit that the next player is to play. \r\nAs an example: Once the six of clubs is played the next player can: \r\n- play any of the other sixes \r\n- play any of the clubs \r\n- play any eight (must declare the suit) \r\n- draw from the stockpile \r\n\r\nPoints are incurred for any cards left on hand at the end of a round - 25pts for an eight, 10pts for a face card, and face value for a spot card. Game over once looser reaches 100 pts, at that point the winner is the one with lowest score.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDQGWM","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Bubble Drop Frenzy","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63255.9007199266654722.f1bcd0bd-1f97-4624-b36b-876cc821f63b.6b583948-47ff-4aaf-a7bd-69a550731f81","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.62333.9007199266654722.d48bab5c-11e1-45b4-8de4-8907783831c9.00b84655-d59c-445f-974e-5e93b7d422a6","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.16841.9007199266654722.f0b735dc-89e2-4a1e-8961-8aad5ea375c5.e70dc9ed-9364-4a8c-b226-bade47b5b7d6","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.52320.9007199266654722.a8a2410f-32aa-4d75-9381-8de59de25662.0b13173b-7e17-42f5-b3fc-30ea49dec9f5","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.19664.9007199266654722.a3b6c035-0008-40c8-b6f5-11865c162780.8baa3ffa-31be-45b1-ac3d-27065c52fd64","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.50430.9007199266654722.2d96643c-b15c-473e-baf0-061d9ebb29b6.af6c0401-db00-4178-a486-76182ee87898","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["42197DaveK.BubbleDropFrenzy_h0vae31d58w0j"],"ContentIds":["d5436f0a-7137-16d4-ade9-64d8abbda3e2","869dbdbb-e0d6-a42e-2aa8-93ca03ab7909"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Are you ready for a bubble drop frenzy?

Recall your childhood!\r\n\r\nLudo game that traces its lineage to 6th century India. Ludo is derived from game Pachisi. Ludo is also very similar to Spanish board game.\r\n\r\nLudo game has stayed popular throughout the ages, varying only a little in its game structure. This persevering game is now available for you to play in an all new modernized format, i.e. as a video game application.\r\n\r\nThe game is played between 2 to 4 players and you have the option of playing the game against the computer, against your friends, or even against people from around the world. The objective of the game is pretty straightforward; each player gets 4 tokens, these tokens must make a full turn of the board and then make it to the finish line.\r\n\r\nWhoever gets all four tokens to the end first is the winner. However, each move can only be made based on the number decided by casting a six-sided die, and each token can only move out of their home by casting a six. Additionally, the competition factor of the games is upped by the fact that while moving if another player’s token lands on the same square as your token, then your token will automatically be sent back home and you’ll need to roll a six again.\r\n\r\nLudo King is a game that was played by kings and now it can be enjoyed by you and your family and friends. While the game play might seem simple at first, the game is immensely enjoyable and challenging. You’ll be playing this one for hours and its fun for the whole family. Try to beat your opponents and compete for the highest scores on the leaderboards.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH4TNRT","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Forza Motorsport 7","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.10238.13510798887602644.70f218c8-04da-4c69-9834-b35cfb50ab74.373c5817-afea-4935-beb3-dadc14b39b08","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#ffffff","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.56005.13510798887602644.6903d8ce-f3c0-4f96-b43b-d240124e1abb.dc1d28de-a589-4cb5-9313-f5ffd0f701ba","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#ffffff","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.19439.13510798887602644.aa0cca0f-0a2e-4659-8ec1-cc22485ce056.b42593a7-95fd-4baf-8600-e8c2dc58c163","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#ffffff","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.34712.13510798887602644.52fba1c4-955b-4f75-b7bd-4528759aa205.d0e8662d-74c8-44b1-b868-d326a8a9f7d7","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.27100.13510798887602644.e06d6ca7-79aa-4a32-808a-3c1c8158abb8.d583acc8-fc85-48ca-81b5-1001a7322781","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free trial⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["Microsoft.ApolloBaseGame_8wekyb3d8bbwe"],"ContentIds":["3d543684-5f14-1cc4-9ef4-73e077c38633","2599c9d7-3775-453c-b142-a9d258c8ec84"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Xbox One","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Experience the thrill of motorsport at the limit with the most comprehensive, beautiful and authentic racing game ever made. \r\n\r\nForza Motorsport 7 is where Racers, Drifters, Drag Racers, Tuners, and Creators come together in a community devoted to everything automotive.

How? You blow at them with more bubbles, and when three or more of the same color come together, they all explode. Just tap at where you want the next bubble to go.\r\nThe more bubbles blow up at one tap, the increasingly more points you gain (six ones at one tap is better tan two three-bubble taps). Besides, those bubbles that fell apart from the rest will explode too. It is well worth trying to arrange such avalanches, as they will give you ten times more points than ordinary bursts.\r\nAnother important rule to know is that the borders are like mirrors. If you shoot a bubble towards an exposed border, it will not stick to the border but will bounce right back like a stream of light against a mirror. This feature becomes really handful when the center of your board is filled up with and you need to shoot some bubbles on the sidebars.\r\nIf your tap fails to detonate any bubbles, you get a foul, and when there are several fouls, one or two new line of bubbles appears at the top. The number of misfires allowed before bubbles will advance again, is shown by the number of silver ball in the left bottom corner.\r\nThe game is over when you clean all the bubbles off and your score doubles, or bubbles move all the way down on you.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFJCB6","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"MASH+","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.14148.9007199266251625.9288235b-b196-4843-90c9-75a93e71808f.72b763dd-5ae5-41fe-bec5-b42c91857f73","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#217b17","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.771.9007199266251625.8129d602-8640-43d5-a14e-8c8d8f9ea29b.fe8aeebb-20bc-4487-87b5-19831986d7a4","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#217b17","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.6286.9007199266251625.7b6a1b46-fc86-41c1-ae88-11f423b5a3a1.c283348a-bf71-4e23-984c-2464839102b0","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#217b17","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.18503.9007199266251625.6d86c9d1-ac95-444e-b819-710d52d24a7d.6f7ebc1f-b299-47d5-ba6e-b04c2d46e32e","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#217b17","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.25549.9007199266251625.e8f80170-59ba-401f-9314-6e10c3d25998.0ec40dbf-aaa6-48b8-bd07-95a124fbee5a","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#217b17","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.52506.9007199266251625.c59ac70d-9059-4e55-988f-31d95606ef16.bee4dfef-7ad7-4688-8abd-18db19d3d696","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#217b17","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["MagnateInteractiveLtd.MASHPlus_9cvv3eb5w672g"],"ContentIds":["e7788ecf-7852-5889-64df-49084c855320"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"THE ORIGINAL FREE MASH GAME! \r\nWant to find out who you or your friends will marry?

You create a new astronaut, gain levels and experience for every move you make by completing missions in space. You will have access to missions similar to what happened in real life, or fictional missions designed to challenge you as an astronaut.\r\n\r\nSpacecrafts are highly complicated machines with the primary task of exploring and understanding what's outside the atmosphere of Earth, while keeping the astronauts alive for long periods. This is achieved by hundreds of individual systems and backup systems working together. With the help from the in-game Space Flight Academy, the provided flight manual for each spacecraft, and checklists, you will learn how to fly and operate these machines, and explore space in a high resolution and realistic environment.\r\n\r\nControl almost every system like the real astronauts, see the sunset and sunrise while orbiting orbiting Earth with speeds exceeding 25,500 ft/s. Explore the surface of Earth and the Moon with high resolution textures, or simply enjoy the solitude of being in space.\r\n\r\nImagine the final few seconds before launching into space. You are sitting on top of a 111 meter high rocket, looking at the instruments of a spaceship about to leave the oasis we call Earth. The engines are igniting, mechanical systems are clinging below you, while thousands of gallons of fuel is pumping through the systems. The loud roar of the five F1 engines are producing close to 8,000,000 pounds of thrust, violently shaking the cockpit and lifting 3 million kg off the pad. The launch pad tower is slowly moving away from you while the engines are balancing the rocket like a skyscraper on a needle. Sophisticated engineers has created the systems that will safely accelerate you to 25,500 ft/s, into a free fall orbit, with the Moon as the destination.\r\n\r\nWelcome to Reentry, an orbital simulator.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH52XS6","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Call of Duty®: Infinite Warfare","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.14858.13510798887669313.99066cf0-24ea-48f2-92a9-5a0bec805bff.be03ac18-7793-4d69-aa38-9a2defe0e572","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"black","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.27131.13510798887669313.29263ff2-4324-4963-9287-745b7d0c03b1.25735cdc-23c8-462e-b4fa-3742c0f751d6","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.18374.13510798887669313.f8fceaa7-5d92-4081-ac5a-68bf9bedc347.d37c7622-a170-4548-b679-9b144aecc71a","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"StrikethroughPrice":"","DisplayPrice":"","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["38985CA0.PCCallofDutyInfiniteWarfare_5bkah9njm3e9g"],"ContentIds":["979602d7-4229-1ce6-ad04-f892349f3923"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Call of Duty®: Infinite Warfare delivers three unique game modes: Campaign, Multiplayer, and Zombies.\r\n\r\nCampaign is a return to the gritty, military roots of the franchise, while boldly looking ahead, delivering a rich and engaging narrative.

This is absolute madness as the block has been turned into a dead zone jungle. It is time to defend national pride and bring in the big guns. This invasion calls for direct action!\r\n\r\nIt is up to heroic little you to defend the neighbourhood. In this epic turret defence game you are building an army of block defenders with unique skills. You will need to use your fantasy and imagination to conquer the Blockheads once and for all!\r\n\r\nPOWERFUL WEAPONS\r\nLuckily you have some toys to your disposal that can push back the alien invasion.\r\n\r\nBouncer:\r\nBouncers throw tiny bombs that do quite some splash damage. Cheap to build, but has limited range and is best used in large numbers. Summoning bouncers is always a good idea!\r\n\r\nSniper:\r\nShoots enemies from a great distance with a powerful shot. This tower unit has a very wide range and can easily snipe baddies from a far. Unfortunately the sniper does need quite some time to reload itself, but it remains your strongest long range shooter.\r\n\r\nFan:\r\nThe fan unit is not developed to provide a cool breeze in the heat of battle. Instead this fan is very powerful and slows down the approaching army of enemies with a sonic blast. Your other units can then take time and annihilate the competition! Range is quite limited so it is best to place this unit at junctions and close to your other towers.\r\n\r\nTesla turret:\r\nEvery strategy game needs a tesla coil right? This is the most powerful of your units, but also one of the most expensive. It has good range and does a lot of damage. Reload time is relatively quick and it fries enemies with a powerful electrical laser. This is hell-fire of the highest order!\r\n\r\nTurbolaser (from a certain galaxy):\r\nIn later levels you will need this powerful anti air unit as it is the only Block Defender that can shoot flying enemy types. Its X - ray range is limited and you will most likely need a couple of these to counter incoming squadrons. Luckily they are relatively cheap to produce. It can not defend against ground based targets.\r\n\r\nECONOMICS\r\nThese weapons should be sufficient and up to the task. The biggest challenge however, especially in later levels are your economics. You will find that you might need to sell units on the fly in order to purchase new ones. Robots and Blockheads are relentless in their march and it is key to pay attention to where the threat is coming from and what the best counter measures are!\r\n\r\nIn short Block Defender offers a real challenge and with episode unlocks there is always something new just around the corner. And you know what they say - a strategy game a day keeps the brain doctor away!\r\n\r\nKey Features\r\n+ 3 worlds to conquer\r\n+ 30 challenging levels to complete\r\n+ Defend against land, sea and

is a board game for two players. It is played on a square board, made of 64 smaller squares, with eight squares on each side. Each player starts with sixteen pieces: eight pawns, two knights, two bishops, two rooks, one queen and one king. The goal of the game is for each player to try and checkmate the king of the opponent. Checkmate is a threat ('check') to the opposing king which no move can stop. It ends the game.\r\nDuring the game the two opponents take turns to move one of their pieces to a different square of the board. One player ('White') has pieces of a light color; the other player ('Black') has pieces of a dark color. There are rules about how pieces move, and about taking the opponent's pieces off the board. The player with white pieces always makes the first move. Because of this, White has a small advantage, and wins more often than Black in tournament games.\r\nDeveloping Chess strategy and improving your Chess skill!
