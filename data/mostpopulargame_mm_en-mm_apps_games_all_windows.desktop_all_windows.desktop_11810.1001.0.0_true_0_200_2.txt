This game is quite addictive, that's for sure because it is very popular. If you loved Peggle Montezuma, marble woka woka Zuma Deluxe or Zumas Temple Quest. It's about our version of the famous Zuma. For the once that are wondering what kind of game is Zuma, here is little explanation. You will see many colorful balls in the game and the scope of the game is actually very simple - you must join 3 balls with same color on the chain and destroy them. So it sounds very easy and yes, it is but not that easy because it asks for some strategic thinking in order to complete this task.\r\n\r\nAlso you get a chance to choose your playing mode. When you are still a beginner, choose the 'easy mode' but as you become more skilled, the 'hard mode' would be your bigger challenge.\r\n\r\nThe game consists of three levels, three different worlds that hide their own challenges. The first world is 'Amazon jungle', the second one is 'Ancient Ruins' while the third one takes you to the \"Frozen Land\". You start joining the balls and if you don't manage to pass the level, you get a chance to play the level once again. Actually if you are not satisfied by our score in general, you could play again each level you want. Now let's see how is this going in praxis.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9PC3D9J68GDW","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Aeroplane Simulator 3D","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.64751.14111251401979772.74c80de5-a17b-425f-87c9-c34184bd71c2.330b786f-4eb2-426b-9d43-c0ad426ad9f1","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.8362.14111251401979772.74c80de5-a17b-425f-87c9-c34184bd71c2.6b289530-dfd3-458b-ad54-d50daadd9c80","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.29516.14111251401979772.4127734b-24eb-4578-99e6-ee494561580e.90eb7872-1300-4ca4-a488-7524ab00e130","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.8025.14111251401979772.4127734b-24eb-4578-99e6-ee494561580e.b21fe5c3-4f3d-4b7c-8fcb-b7afb879c545","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["459581FB44CE2.AeroplaneSimulator3D_ae1keq66gdrnj"],"ContentIds":["1ff26dc3-5910-8334-b5d4-29b6262f3ad0","e99604e5-947d-4b8b-db8e-e745df454e67"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Aeroplane Simulator is a 3D flying app that allows you to navigate the skies!

Use strategy and command your army of angry spartans to attack your enemies (or friends) and battle your way to glory in Wa r Heroes Clash Battle Boom! THIS… IS… AGE OF SPARTA! Fight alongside the Spartan warriors and a select group of heroes from royale Barbarian ! \r\n\r\nWar Heroes Clash Battle Boom TD is the best castle defense game ever ! The war has just begun. Shooting arrows was never so much fun. \r\n\r\nWar Heroes Clash Battle Boom is simple and easy to play, this game is a combination of strategy, magic and some funny jokes. It requires you plan how to barricade your defenses (don’t just build and upgrade everything you can in a random order) and plan your attacks carefully (just sending every soldier you have won’t cut it) in order to win every battle and make your commander - THE COMMANDER.\r\n\r\n★★★★★ ARCHER WARRIOR VS. ARMIES OF THRACKUS ★★★★★\r\n\r\nThe saga of this god of war is well known in greek history. Some say he is son of Zeus. Another legend is that he was sent on earth by Hades, while another tale has it that he is Apollo himself in disguise. With his Hercules strength he stands like a tower between the mighty force of the demon Thrackus and wall of justice. Equipped with god's armor and blessed with super attack speed, he awaits his share of action. He is leader of clan and the mightiest soldier ever seen.\r\n\r\n★★★★★ WEAPONS AND MAGIC ★★★★★\r\n\r\nVariety potions and spells make killing of evil easier and even more fun. Dragon fire, ice effect or missile - you have it all. Equip your mighty sparta hero with the godly weapons and march towards victory. The clash at gate becomes intense and to save yourself from extra pressure, plant some mines close by. Shoot at the smaller units while you freeze big ones like giants. Beware of cannons and tanks that can launch from a distance. \r\n\r\n★★★★★ COMBAT OF HEORES WITH CLAN LORDS ★★★★★\r\n\r\nEach boss have special powers and you will need some devine help to defeat them. When facing a large crush of armies, to counter them, its lethal strategy to unleash heroes in the middle of battle. They are your friends and alliance in thickest of war. They dont fight with bomb and bullet, but prefer sword and hammer.

If the child selects the wrong shape, then they will be prompted with the correct number. Therefore, the picture will always be colored correctly, and the child will quickly memorize the numbers. Children can choose to color by geometrical figures and pictograms in addition to numbers. A child can easily distinguish a square from a circle, diamond, and triangle.\r\nSchool-age children will enjoy the complex coloring mode. Here the picture is divided into a large number of elements, thus making it difficult at first to determine what it depicts. Older children can complicate the task by adding addition and subtraction tasks. Now children will need to solve the examples and choose the correct answers in order to color the picture. This will teach the child how to quickly do arithmetic in their mind.\r\nThose who are learning the alphabet can choose to color by letter. Coloring by letters will be useful for children preparing to enter primary school.\r\nTo make the coloring process more interesting and fun, you can change any of the preset colors. To do this, press and hold the jar of paint and a palette will open. Then you can choose your favorite color. Thus, all the shaded areas of the image can be changed in the coloring by number mode. You can have fun by changing the color scheme to suit your taste.

Race to the top of the board by riding on your luck! Test your luck against friends and family. If you find no one else, test your luck against android!!\r\n\r\nTrivia:\r\nSnakes and Ladders, known as Moksha Patam, originated in ancient India as part of a family of dice board games and made its way to England and was known as \"Snakes and Ladders\", then the basic concept was introduced in the United States as Chutes and Ladders. The game was popular in ancient India and emphasized the role of fate or karma.\r\n\r\nRules:\r\nEach player starts in an imaginary space below square marked as '1' and takes turn to roll single die and move their corresponding game piece by the number rolled on the die. Game pieces follow a fixed route which is marked by a plough track from the bottom to the top of the game board. If on completion of steps marked by number rolled on die the player lands on lower numbered end of a ladder, the player moves to the higher end of the ladder. Similarly, if the player lands on higher numbered end of snake, he must move to the lower end of the snake. The player that reaches to the last square of the board first is the winner!\r\n\r\nWe provide you following options to change rules to allow you greater control:\r\n* Start game only when 6 is rolled - This adds a bit of challenge as you (and android in case of single player) need to roll 6 before you can move your game piece.\r\n* Land exactly on 100 to win - If you are up to a bigger challenge, set this option for greater thrill. If this rule is enabled, then you (and android in case of single player) need to land exactly on 100 in order to win. If you roll die such that you go beyond hundred, then your game piece will not move. You can still get another turn if you rolled six, even though your piece will not move.\r\n* End game when any one player wins - When playing in 3 or 4 players mode, enabling this option will ensure that the game ends as soon as any one player wins. It shortens the game, but you'll miss out on fun of finding out who came second or third!!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGGZMC4D","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Snowboard Party Lite","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.8573.13510798883381455.5a485c19-0272-4516-a4c6-8c8580b0a864.217d9c9b-b4cd-477d-9f2b-0c6fdf7f6708","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.60170.13510798883381455.ce3c877e-f8b0-4680-8b2b-296565887374.c2907c45-a299-4938-93be-da321d433e1f","Height":225,"Width":225,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.34735.13510798883381455.2a2935ae-6abb-4ddf-8624-91e193155a87.a96ba0fe-4f23-4151-82e4-d552baff0da1","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.57690.13510798883381455.89e8fd53-bf70-4fc7-bf6b-fede74217a1c.cc4b50e3-d407-455c-b8f5-6cbf3f4e0ced","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.59680.13510798883381455.a36eeea1-7e1f-4219-a4fe-956e67de0bff.fc1b9d1d-9d50-4256-b722-07f18222c964","Height":465,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.43510.13510798883381455.9cc043c7-eb78-4544-a977-f7d9fc88c85b.07b8c95a-92d4-4e89-98b0-f09615c51221","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.33335.13510798883381455.4ad418b1-7960-4a9f-8b98-fc0e4b3dee5f.b7ef3de2-9182-4a53-8033-fa2dfec0795d","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.67.13510798883381455.980516f0-740c-4876-aa61-0e30905b4911.be88fd73-410d-4a6c-b00d-7532673e305f","Height":225,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.6525.13510798883381455.e6c9d8d6-a254-4709-b66b-7b84fe62aafa.5c2254b3-f519-4c16-bfe5-938f2cd0d8e3","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.54660.13510798883381455.068bf038-068c-4e98-9631-3cb3defefa88.091bd83e-e2e4-4e9a-b360-ece348f20a5b","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["F223684A.SnowboardPartyLite_0ecc88g07fveg"],"ContentIds":["0ad62263-e992-3532-cfb5-3321e0fa27af","7023d138-f805-c3f5-dd44-7217aa76c188","1fc18c78-1acc-4d0d-e065-3e2bc9e66895"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Snowboard Party brings the thrill of snowboarding to your mobile device!

Teleport around, explore the arena, have a conversation, or do a silly dance together. Once you are ready, join into the arena for a casual game. Simply guess what someone else is drawing or draw something for others to guess. NEW: multiplayer MR Paintball, splatter your friends or the arena with lovely colors. Remember to dodge and refill!\r\n\r\nFollow us on Twitter at https://twitter.com/Paint_Arena and share videos or screenshots of your best 3D paintings or MR paintball games with hashtag #Paint_Arena :)\r\n\r\nConceptualization: \r\nMany virtual reality games today are designed to enhance graphic intensity and immersion, but increasingly isolate the players. We believe Windows Mixed Reality can be much more than that. We decided to design a casual game that people of all ages can play, share, and socialize in mixed reality. We were inspired by a classic interactive puzzle game for friends and family, while we were amazed by the potential of the mixed reality motion controllers, so Paint Arena was born. Many thanks to Mixed Reality Academy for the paint brush example.  \r\n\r\nInstructions:\r\nYou will need a HoloLens or a WMR immersive headset with a mixed reality motion controllers (and headphones, if not Samsung Odyssey) to enjoy this experience.\r\n\r\nThis social experience is best enjoyed in a casual standing pose. If you feel you are not at the right height after app launch, simply stand up, look forward, and say or tap \"Reset Floor Level\". \r\n\r\nYou could draw and talk to others and guess each others' drawings. If you are the first one to join, you would be assigned the drawer for the first round. You would be given a random word. Draw something to help others guess the word (without drawing any letters or digits). Once someone guesses your word correctly, a guesser will chosen at random to become the drawer. \r\n\r\nToggle \"Painting On\" to \"Paint Balling\" to start shooting paintballs and splatter the arena. Each full tank contains 100 paintballs. Every 5 seconds, you can partially refill the tank with 20 paintballs by pressing \"Refill 20 Paintballs\" button or saying the voice command \"Refill Paint Ball\". Try to move around to dodge incoming paintballs, or teleport to reposition. Score by reducing others' health bars to zero, upon which they would enter ghost mode and respawn at a random location in 10 seconds. \r\n\r\nIn Immersive headsets: Make sure you set up boundary for all experiences before you begin. While \"Painting On\", once you see your robotic right hand holding a paint brush, you can press the right hand trigger button to start drawing. While \"Paint Balling\", you can aim with your right hand controller, and press right hand trigger to shoot paintballs.\r\n\r\nOnce you see your robotic left arm holding a motion controller, you can use the touch pad to select paint color. Alternatively, you can tap \"Pick Color\" to bring up the large color wheel. \r\n\r\nIf you made a mistake, you can say \"Erase Last Stroke\" or press right hand controller grab button. You can also clear all strokes by saying \"Erase All Strokes\". \r\n\r\nTo rotate your view, point the joysticks left or right on one of the motion controllers. \r\n\r\nTo teleport, make sure the panel shows \"Teleport On\". Then point your cursor at the floor with one of the motion controllers, and hold the joystick forward until a Teleport marker appears, then release the joystick. \r\n\r\nIn HoloLens, you can use gaze, tap gesture to select options on the menu in front of you (look below chest level). You can use the same voice commands as elaborated above. While \"Painting On\", you can reach your hand out in front of you, pinch and hold while dragging the paint brush along. While \"Paint Balling\", you can aim with your gaze and air tap to shoot paintballs.\r\n\r\nBefore teleporting in HoloLens, make sure the panel shows \"Teleport On\". Then you can use your gaze to aim, and then tap to dash across the map! You could also hide the Guessing Window and the Panel if they are blocking your gazes. Remember to turn off teleport before drawing or shooting. \r\n\r\n\r\n","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NGZW75QC8MM","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Army Truck Simulator - Military Truck Driving","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.2073.13635678249823218.fa266121-9ec4-4f76-8513-83faf4dc7ff4.f612dd6b-bcc6-4dff-9d66-f34f3e831187","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.40544.13635678249823218.55b58721-c050-4f3e-85b7-4b5e0356aaaa.03a365a3-8b40-453f-80ac-99a9b75683ee","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.54024.13635678249823218.c99d0219-fe70-4d42-8ffb-6f393b46ad56.1efe1e24-3ba4-402a-aebd-7e02f7d0266e","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["56499UkArtsGames.ArmyTruckSimulator-MilitaryTruckD_ep77ya5xk0qyg"],"ContentIds":["566d1be4-c5ca-9fc6-b87a-49dc92780c6b","a42a1ec2-3cab-da93-1ae4-36fd88f663c2"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"ARMY TRUCK SIMULATOR\r\n\r\nIt’s time to drive Army Truck Simulator.

cards. The computer game was originally created by Brodie Lockard in 1981 and named Mah-Jongg after the game that uses the same tiles for play. Lockard claims that it was based on a centuries-old Chinese game called \"the Turtle\". However, it was not until Activision released Shanghai in 1986 for the Macintosh and Apple IIgs that the game gathered momentum. A version of this game was also included in the Microsoft Entertainment Pack for Windows 3.x in 1990 and went by the name Taipei. It was subsequently included in the Best of Windows Entertainment Pack. Premium editions of the Windows Vista operating system and Windows 7 include a version of the game known as Mahjong Titans. \r\nAs any other successful game, millions of clones have been created on all possible platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We tried to recreate all the fun of original game with 60 different layouts in a tiny download package. \r\nA tile that can be moved left or right without disturbing other tiles is said to be exposed. Exposed pairs of identical tiles (Flower and Seasons tiles in the same group being considered identical) are removed from the layout one at a time, gradually exposing the lower layers to play. The aim of the game is to clear the layout by pairing up all the tiles. The game is finished when either the layout is empty, or there are no exposed pairs remaining.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDM0XZ","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Off Road Drift Series","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.28130.9007199266432138.057a4908-8e11-4830-ac98-70215d4f1194.e39ed3e1-62ab-404e-9738-52b1f13f172c","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.50607.9007199266432138.fee16876-03bb-4879-8913-04fff7503f14.67dd7cd2-0b27-442b-a1f5-e1452909768b","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["65284GameCabbage.OffRoadDriftSeries_2yb7x3f347z2c"],"ContentIds":["bd1211d9-4cb1-88f5-d54d-3f697f5905f2","061031b7-e640-3e97-1c1d-56b2876d7930"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Off Road racing with real physics.
